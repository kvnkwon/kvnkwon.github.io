                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p>Pair programming is when two people work together on a project sharing a keyboard and monitor. Sounds disatrous right? Maybe. However, this setup not only works most of the time but also provides greater efficiency and quality. How is this possible when a pair has to share the keyboard? Won't there be a clash between the partners at some point when typing and modifying code? This leads us to...</p>
                <h2>Navigator versus Driver</h2>
                    <p>Pair programming is made possible with these two roles: the Navigator and Driver. The driver exclusively gets to touch the keyboard and is the one responsible for the actual typing. The navigator, like its title, keeps his or her hand off the keyboard and essentially gives the driver directions. The navigator is actually the one responsible for thinking about the overall design of the project.Responsibilities of the navigator include checking each line of code that the driver writes and making sure there are no errors. Also, the navigator must keep the driver focused on the task at hand. The driver should only focus at the line of code they are currently working on, instead of trying to see the bigger picture of the project. A common misconception about the driver is that its a passive role that only types whatever the navigator dictates. The driver and navigator should both actively communicate and discuss on how the code should be written. A successful pair programming session must have the partners switch up roles time to time. No one should ever be stuck with one role for the entire session.</p>
                <h2>Why do it?</h2>
                    <p>Two heads are better than one? Sure, but there are many more reasons to why pair programming is beneficial. One can expect results from a pair programming session to include: code with fewer errors, code that is easier to read and maintain, higher morale, better time management, and higher productivity.</p>
