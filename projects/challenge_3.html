            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
              <p>
              Where are you viewing this website from? Is it a phone,
              tablet, or computer? Have you ever wondered why a certain webpage looks better on your computer monitor than it does on your small mobile phone? Websites that do not look good across your devices are probably not using responsive web design. Responsive web design is intentionally built to accomadate the everchanging resolutions and sizes of devices in today's world. Basically, this is accomplished using two features: Fluid layouts and media queries.
              </p>
            <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
              <p>
                Have you ever resized a web page using your browser and noticed that the web content is actually moving with it? Web pages are utilizing a fluid grid, a key part to what makes responsive design, "responsive." Also known as liquid layouts, the ability to react and change with the browser's scale is extremely important in today's market because of the increasing number of screen resolutions. When a user views a webpage from a high resolution 27" monitor to a tiny screen on a mobile device, they can expect to see all of the elements on the page transform their size in relation with each other. Pretty amazing right? Although fluid layouts made monumental steps forward, it does not solve every problem. Sometimes when the browser's width becomes too narrow, the elements on the site start to severely break down in a chaotic and disorganized fashion. To combat this problem, we go to the next part of responsive design...
              </p>
            <h2>Media Queries</h2>
              <p>Although fluid grids allow for great resizing, sometimes you want to actually eliminate items for mobile viewing or add items for viewing on plus sized monitors. This means having different CSS properties for different screen sizes. The original solution to this problem was to create a "mobile" version or "tablet" version of a website, but thanks to media queries, we can actually keep all of this information in one site.</p>
              <p>Media queries are a way that your webpage can ask the web browser for certain properties of the page, like its size. This means that you can set break points for your site at different screen pixel minimum widths. If the screen has below 320 pixels, you know it's a mobile phone, so you can set your CSS to optomize for the mobile environment by doing things like stacking certain elements or removing sidebars. You can put in as many breakpoints as you'd like, but you probably only need a few.</p>
              <p>The actual CSS required looks like this:</p>
              <img src="http://oi62.tinypic.com/f4kbjk.jpg">
              <p>If you want to see this example in action, re-size this window to 900px and watch the big ugly sidebar turn blue!</p>
              <p>Although color changes might not be the most practical use of media queries, it demonstrates how powerful this tool can be in creating a responsive design.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>Implementing responsive design was challenging but rewarding. It was hard to visualize how everything should be scaled in other devices, but it was cool to see how everything fell in place at the end. Smartphones and tablets have completely changed the way people think and approach web design. In this day and age, people do not only use computers to do their web browsing. On tablets and phones, screen sizes and resolutions are all different which require web pages to accomodate these changes. As long as new technologies emerge that change the way we browse the web, web design will have to keep up. I could imagine a future where people enter a virtual reality form of the web, in which they can interact with different pages on a whole different level. Get ready.. Web design is about to reach a whole new level.
