            <h3>What is the Stereotype Threat?</h3>
            <p>
              According to <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">(Steele and Aronson, 1995)</a>, "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype aout one's group." "It is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. Call it subconscious self-handicapping<a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">(Diversity Inc)</a>." The reality of educational and work places is that the Stereotype Threat is ever present and is serving as a huge obstacle for many groups of people including: Blacks, women, and other underrepresented groups. When students feel the effects of the Stereotype Threat, they begin to feel anxious which leads to increased body temperature and heart rate which ultimately leads to distraction and poorer performance. It is possible to underperform under Stereotype Threat because one might feel as if they are getting judged. For example, a female student might have the huge pressure that she cannot complete a certain task because of her gender and she is afraid that while she tries at it, she might ultimately fail and confirm everyones' stereotypes regarding her gender. This anxiety and pressure could impact her performance even though she is completely capable of completing the task.

            <h3>Stereotype Threat and Me</h3>
            <p>
              As I look back into my life during my high school years, I could probably point out certain times when I indeed felt under the Stereotype Threat. Since I am Korean, I fall under the stereotype regarding most East Asians that we are amazing at math. There was a time during class where I was called up to the board so that I could write a solution to the problem. I was not the biggest fan of math. Even though I was really weak in math, I was definitely capable of solving that specific problem on the board, but I started to feel tense and anxious. The other students were watching and I felt as though I was being watched under the lens of a stereotype. I was supposed to be good at math, and if I failed to deliver, I knew I would be laughed or judged against. It is a feeling that I remember very strongly, and I will make sure that I will try to avoid making anyone else feel the Stereotype Threat. If I suspect that someone else will be feeling it, I do not think it to be wise saying to them directly that I do not view them through the lens of their stereotype. That'd be too direct and awkward. I would instead probably try to make them feel as comfortable as possible by making the atmosphere lighter with some humor here and there or positive feedback. I believe that the anxiety will be suppressed as long as good and positive vibes are being emitted.
