            <h2>The Pipeline Problem in Tech</h2>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Recently, Google released the diversity numbers on its workforce and it's not looking diverse at all. 30% of Google's employees worldwide are women and only 17% of Google's female workforce represents a tech-oriented role. Google's U.S. workforce is largely dominated by white males. Only thirty percent of their workforce is Asian, while Hispanics and African-Americans represent an extremely low 3 percent and 2 percent respectively. Google is not the only tech company that suffers from a lack of diversity. Tech companies all over the United States have similar ratios as Google. There are many who wish to see a more diverse tech-community, but the diversity ratios will remain stagnant unless transformation takes place in schools.

            <h3>Can schools be the solution?</h3>
            <p>
              If children from a young age are exposed to computer science, more opportunities could emerge for them. Many people are turned off by pursuing computer science in college because they think it is too hard, too heavy in mathematics, or simply too "nerdy." If kids grow up with computer science, they will realize that such accusations are not entirely true and may have a different view on computer science. If students learn that they can make positive impacts on their community with products they can build from coding, computer science will definitely attract a more diverse crowd looking to make a change.
