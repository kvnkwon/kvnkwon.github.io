              I am familiar with coding bootcamps. I've already completed one in Boston, and now I'm going for a second round with Devbootcamp NYC. There are many reasons why I chose to do a coding bootcamp again. I wanted to strengthen my fundamentals, especially because I did not feel ready. This was not because of the bootcamp's inadequacy to teach, but my own shortcomings. I wanted to be truly ready for day one of the developer job and I wanted to do whatever it took. I see Devbootcamp as my second chance, the opportunity for me to truly take the knowledge given and soar with it. Upon watching<a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> Shereef's Fireside Chat</a>, I felt even more excited for DBC. The topics that he covered reminded me what I loved so much about coding bootcamps and I was relieved that I was going to continue to grow within that culture at DBC. I won't lie and say that I'm not nervous. I might even be worrying more now than my first attempt at a bootcamp. The stakes are higher for me personally this time around and I want to make use of this second chance as much as possible. I know the pacing and speed of the learning at bootcamps is extremely fast. I fell behind on some topics during my first bootcamp which resulted in a lot of technical debt. However, I am now familar with all of the topics so I feel excited to reinforce all that knowledge during my stay at DBC. "Own your experience," is a quote I heard often during my stay in Boston. I might have fallen short on that the first time around, but I know now for sure.. I'm going to own the DBC experience no matter what.
