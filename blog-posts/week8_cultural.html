            <h2>A Look Back into a Personal Conflict</h2>
            <p>
              So DBC asks us to look back into a conflict we had with someone and analyze it. I remember a conflict I had back at college with one of my roommates. Basically, our living room was a mess because of the constant people that my roommate invited on a daily basis. Everyday, the garbage that they left kept piling and piling into our trash can, but my roommate was not doing anything about it. My other roommate and I both had trash cans in our own room that we regularly take out. The trash can in the living room was extremely overpopulated with crap that was a direct product of my roommate's constant inviting of friends. I was shocked at the fact that he was ignoring to take out the trash and expecting someone else to do it when he should take responsibility over his own guests and the mess that they created. I approached my roommate and asked him whether he was going to ever take out the trash. Boom. I expected a response that went like, "Alright," or "I'll do it later," but nothing prepared me for the anger that exploded out of my roommate. He proceeded to yell and question why he should be the one cleaning the trash in the living room when that trash is one that should be shared with all the people living there. He maintained that he cleaned the trash before, and that it was someone else's turn to clean it this time. He might have had a fair argument if we even used that trash can once, but the trash that was present in the can was all from his guests. From the yelling that was going on, I knew this was going nowhere. I just ignored him and took out the trash myself.

              Did my actions make the conflict better or worse? Hmm. I think when I confronted him about taking out the trash made the entire conflict worse. I think that I should have maybe just took out the trash first, then say that he should clean it next time. Or... maybe not. I think either way, due to his personality, would have ended in a similar fashion. Perhaps, I should have just took out the trash myself and not say anything. Maybe he would have felt some guilt, but then again.. I don't think that would have worked either. Should I have left the trash there and let it rot until he finally decides that the trash needs to be taken out? I think I would rather deal with him than rats personally so I don't think that was the solution either. Ultimately, I learned from this experience that some people are just going to be stubborn and unwilling to cooperate. I should just avoid those situations altogether.
