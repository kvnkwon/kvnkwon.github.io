            <h2>A good question?</h2>
            <p>
              Was there a time that you felt frustrated when you asked a question that was not answered? Did you think it was a good question? What makes a good question? As I think of my past experiences, there were definitely times that I did not get the answer I sought. It was frustrating to not get the proper answer that I wanted and sometimes I would even feel annoyed that the person answering my question was not helping. The problem though was not the answerer, but the one asking the questions. I realized that most of the questions that I asked were not specific enough and very vague. It's hard to diagnose some of the problems that I had if I did not point specifically to what was wrong. Simply stating that this was not working because of 'X' reason was not specific enough. I needed to go more in depth by mentioning what I have done to solve the problem, what I think was happening, and under what circumstance was the problem happening?
