            <h3>My pairing experiences</h3>
            <p>
              Pair programming is a crucial practice that is heavily integrated into DBC's curriculum. It is something that we as developers need to get comfortable with in order to have further success beyond DBC. Sure, there are many companies where pairing is unneccessary, but through my experiences, I found that pair programming led to very efficient and fruitful results. There are times when I hit serious mental roadblocks during coding. These roadblocks can sometimes be easily overcome, but when they're not- Oh boy, I would need a whole another blog post to convey my feelings. I found myself avoiding these messy situations during pair programming. Even if I hit mental roadblocks, I could count on my partner to help me out of it. If my partner hits the same roadblock as I do? It's still fine because we're in it together, and we're trying to work together to get out of it. Having a partner with me gives me more responsibilities, which in turn makes me work harder to solve any obstacle. It is way easier to give up when you're in it alone. The feeling that you get when you both work through an obstacle is liberating. In that moment of triumph, you believe anything is possible.. a feeling that is shortlived once you encounter another problem- but hey, you can live through it again and again by knocking down each obstacle.

              Any frustrations I had with pair programming? Of course, but it's not the practice of pair programming that is at fault but rather the actual person you are pairing with. Like any other activity that involves a pair working together to solve challenges, if you do not get along with your pair, you're going to have a bad time. Personally, I only had positive pairing experiences during DBC's prep phase, but there were times before DBC that I had really bad pairing sessions. There was this one time where my partner was considerably more technically skilled than I was. Instead of communicating together before the code was written, my partner proceeded to write the entire program. I tried to "navigate" while he drove, but the stuff he was writing made little sense to me the amateur. I asked him question after question and even pleaded for him to slow down. Sometimes he would answer my question, but most of the times he stared at me with very intense eyes and said, "Hold on." Well, I did wait for him and it was only until the entire program was complete that he decided to explain everything to me. It was cool that he got the program down, but what was the point of me pairing with him? I was simply a spectator with a bag of popcorn being the only thing missing.
