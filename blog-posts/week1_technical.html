            <h2>Three Awesome Websites</h2>
            <h3>Reddit</h3>

              When I think of any single site that is able to deliver both entertainment and educational news, Reddit is automatically the winner. Most of the reason why I use the web can be satisfied with Reddit. If I want news about video games, I could browse their gaming subreddit, or if I wanted to hear news about a specific game, there is a subreddit for that as well. Anything from gaming, sports, world news, and even a subreddit for people answering any question through AmA's; Reddit covers it all. It does such a good job that I find myself on Reddit exclusively as opposed to other sites that could deliver comparable news and information. Upon launching the site, you immediately see the posts that are trending in a very simple and easy to read layout. Reddit gives you the ability to search from its massive collection of subreddits to find exactly what you are looking for.The best part about it? It's quick and easy without any interruption from popups or annoying advertisements that frequently plague other websites. Reddit is not the most beautiful looking website, but its efficiency and simplicity makes up for it. I would not have it any other way.

            <h3>Kickstarter</h3>

              When I first heard about Kickstarter, I was mindblown about the idea of crowdfunding and the potential of its growth. When I look at Kickstarter now, I see how far they've come with a neverending supply of users entering the website to seek potential projects worth investing. Visually, the site is very appealing with a clean and very structured design. The navbar has a search function built into it which allows for precise and easy navigation. The two other buttons in the navbar point exactly where most users will want to go upon reaching the site. If you scroll down their homepage, there is a section for staff picks with every category on the side. This allows for users to quickly find a project that they might have missed before. As a user that wants to start their own project, Kickstarter makes this process easy by making sure you are well-informed. Upon clicking the start button in the navbar, users are redirected to a page that has a wealth of information about how Kickstarter works and what is available to them as a project creator. Ultimately, Kickstarter delivers in everything they set out to do, but most importantly, they deliver it well.

            <h3>Rotten Tomatoes</h3>

              Rotten Tomatoes is not the best looking site. On the front page, there might be too many sections pushed against each other making it hard for the eyes to focus on one thing... except the left section where the real reason for many users visiting this website is. In the left, users are able to see the movies that have just opened, the top box office, and movies that are coming soon. Next to these movie titles are a graphic of a tomato or a green splat indicating rottenness. Depending on the movie review score, the tomato will either be fresh or rotten. This clear graphic and accompanying movie review score allow for users to immediately get what they came for. I know most of the users that go on RT do so for the purpose of seeing whether a specific movie got good reviews or not. It helps that the front page allows for users to quickly get what they came for. If the user is not satisfied with just looking at the score, they can click on the movie title which acts as a link that leads to a page with more detailed reviews from both professional and public user reviews. I find myself going to the movies very often, and my choice of movie is sometimes influenced by review ratings. When I am unsure of whether to watch a certain movie, I know that I can go to RT and get exactly what I'm looking for with ease.
