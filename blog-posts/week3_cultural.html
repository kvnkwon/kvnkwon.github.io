            <h2>My Thinking Style VS DBC</h2>
            <h3>Abstract Random?</h3>
            <p>
              According to the Gregorc Thinking Style criteria, my thinking style is called, "Abstract Random." "Abstract random thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments (<a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">source</a>)."
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the definition above, DBC should be an ideal spot for me to thrive and learn. DBC is not like any school or formal education I've had in the past, but it's a place that can be called very "people-oriented." DBC is not bound by a limited/conservative structure that is so often found in formal education today. I learn a lot from actually getting first-hand experience with the material and this learning is only boosted when I'm working with other people. I thrive on teamwork and collaboration, two things that are emphasized at DBC and other AR thinkers prosper from.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm currently in phase 0 of DBC, which is the phase right before going to their onsite location to learn. As I continue to pursue my studies at home, I found myself running into some trouble. An AR thinker's weakness includes time limits and strict/inflexible schedules. DBC's phase 0 is extremely strict with its work and the time alloted to complete them. Since I am trying to pursue my studies on top of my work and personal life, I found myself being extremely constraint on time. Instead of truly having fun and exploring the material, sometimes it feels like a race to complete it as soon as possible. Actually, this kinda feels like the traditional education model where students are expected to complete material as soon as possible to satisfy deadlines. There were certain times, where I wanted to dig deeper into the material, but I decided to skip over it because of the tremendous amount of other challenges that await. It's only been three weeks so maybe the other weeks might be different.
