            <h2>A look into myself..</h2>
            <p>
              Ok so.. DBC gave us a list of values that we're supposed to choose and write about. The values we choose should be the ones that came to mind when I was happiest or most satisfied in my life. From that long list of words, I immediately chose three: Accomplishment, Confidence, and Recognition. So why those three? Before entering the path to become a super cool developer, I had other dreams.I wanted to be a filmmaker and I was happiest when I was out shooting movies with my friends. I remember in High School, I submitted a zombie film for the film festival and won. It was at that moment, I realized that I had made big steps in chasing my dream which led to a huge feeling of accomplishment. I was recognized by my peers and my parents, who did not completely support this dream until they saw what I could do. I was going to film school in the Fall and I was more confident than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
              So DBC then asked me to rate on a 1-5 scale of how much I try to live up to these values.
              <ul>
                <li>Accomplishment: 5</li>
                <li>Confidence: 5</li>
                <li>Recognition: 5</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Ok. After rating them, I realized that most people would have given them the same rating. I mean, who else wouldn't try to feel accomplished, confident, and be recognized? I think DBC was trying to get me to rate the other values on the list that would make more sense with these ratings. Oh well.
            </p>
            <p>
              What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Another question by DBC. Hmm. A friend of mine is struggling with his career path. He does not want to pursue his nursing studies any longer, and he asks if he should go to a coding bootcamp to become a developer. Ha! I honestly could not really give him the best advice. After all, I'm in his shoes right now as well except that I made the decision to go for it. I have to see my outcome to be able to give anyone advice, but I told him, if he can imagine himself twenty years down the road working on a computer looking at magical text called code on a daily basis- he should be good. Good advice? Meh.
